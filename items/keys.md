	<p class="lead">A small keyring holds access to my world: the front door, bicycle lock, and a few storage compartments I use every week. I keep my keys organized with a couple of color-coded tags and a compact carabiner so they’re easy to find. Despite being tiny, they represent mobility and security — losing them interrupts my plans immediately.</p>

	<p><strong>Why I can't leave home without it:</strong> Without my keys I risk being locked out of home or unable to use transportation I depend on; they’re small but essential items that enable my day-to-day routine.</p>
