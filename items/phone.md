	<p class="lead">My phone is more than a communication device — it’s my camera, map, organizer, and emergency tool all in one. I rely on it for quick directions, instant photo documentation, two-factor authentication, contactless payments, and keeping important notes. It also stores important apps and tickets that make travel and daily errands much smoother.</p>

	<p><strong>Why I can't leave home without it:</strong> Without my phone I lose access to navigation, messaging, and tools I use every day to stay organized; it's how I coordinate plans, capture moments, and handle unexpected situations.</p>
