	<p class="lead">My wallet keeps the essentials together: identification, payment methods, and small personal items I can't easily replace. It also functions as a place to store membership cards, emergency contact notes, and other small documents I sometimes need at short notice. Even in a mostly digital world I find a compact wallet saves time and prevents awkward situations.</p>

	<p><strong>Why I can't leave home without it:</strong> Leaving without my wallet means losing immediate access to payment and ID — a small mistake that can turn into a big hassle when I need to buy something or prove who I am.</p>
